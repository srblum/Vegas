Add more game options
Improve UI for game parameter selection (panels that expand/retract)
Add axis labels
Add axis transitions between simulations (take from Chapter 9, axes_dynamic.html)
At end of animation, display summary statistics ON GRAPH (final average, % broke, best night)
Scale y-axis minimum value to minimum cash value in cashArrs
Separate graph for final outcome distribution (pdf function line graph)
Have axes present BEFORE runSim is called.

TODO (Extras):
Put online
Test mobile compatibility
Scale page with viewport size
